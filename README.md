# Daehyun Jung Portfolio Website

## Description:
Welcome to my first portfolio website! This site is designed to showcase my skills, projects, and the journey I've embarked on as a new developer. It features a standard portfolio layout with a twistâ€”an interactive icon that moves to random places on the screen, adding a playful element to the user experience.

## Features

- Skills: A visual representation of my technical skills using icons.
